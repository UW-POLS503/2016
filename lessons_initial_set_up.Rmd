## Learning Objectives

- You will make sure you have the latest version of R
- You will create a GitHub account
- You will learn how to use GitHub in RStudio
- You will learn how to use the function `install_github()` from the `devtools` pakcages to download R packages from GitHub

## Latest R version

Some of the packages we will use during this course require the latest R version. So let's now take the moment to be sure that everybody has it. Type `version` in the R console to check what version you have. The latest one is verison 3.2.4 (2016-03-10). If you don't have it, follow the next steps to update it:

- Go to the [R Project](https://cran.fhcrc.org/) website
- Choose the link to `Download R for` your operation system (Linux, Mac, or Windows)
    - Mac users: Download `R-3.2.4.pkg`
    - Windows users: First click on `base` and then on `Download R 3.2.4 for Windows`
- Restart RStudio

## Creating a GitHub account

In this course we will use Git, a version control system that allows you to track changes and share your code, and you will submit most of your assignments through GitHub, a website that implements Git and allows you to share code with others. Most software developers use these tools and a large number of R packages are hosted in and can be downloaded from GitHub. 

To start using GitHub, you first need to have an account. If you don't have one,  go to this [link](https://github.com/join?source=header-home) to sign up.
