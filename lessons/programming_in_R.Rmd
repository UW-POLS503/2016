### Learning Objectives
- Learn some basic R programming to make our code less redundant, more efficient, and to speed up the coding process
- Functions
- `for` loops
- `if` and `else` statements

### `Functions`
Why should we use functions? Well, don't take it from me, take it from [Grolemund & Wickham (2016)](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/functions.html):

*Writing a function has three big advantages over using copy-and-paste:*

  1. *You drastically reduce the chances of making incidental mistakes when you copy and paste.*
  2. *As requirements change, you only need to update code in one place, instead of many.*
  3. *You can give a function an evocative name that makes your code easier to understand.*
