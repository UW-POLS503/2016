> Before we tell you how [to use version control], we will start with a fact. (This is, after all, a handbook for empirical
> researchers.) Not one piece of commercial software you have on your PC, your phone, your tablet,
> your car, or any other modern computing device was written with the “date and initial” method. (Shapiro and Gentzkow, [Code and Data for the Social Sciences:
A Practitioner’s Guide](http://www.brown.edu/Research/Shapiro/pdfs/CodeAndData.pdf))

## Readings

- Jenny Bryan, Karen Cranston, Justin Kitzez, Lex Nederbragt, Tracy Teal, and Greg Wilson. [Good Enough Practices for Scientific Computing](http://swcarpentry.github.io/good-enough-practices-in-scientific-computing/).
- Matthew Gentzkow and Jesse M. Shapiro. [Code and Data for the Social Sciences: A Practitioner's Guide](http://swcarpentry.github.io/good-enough-practices-in-scientific-computing/). March, 2014. Especially Chapter 3: Version Control. The principles of this are good though I don't follow all their exact prescriptions. Thr practices adopted for this class are closer to "Good Enough Practices."
