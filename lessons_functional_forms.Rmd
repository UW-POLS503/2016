## Learning Objectives

- Learning about multiple ways of transforming your covariates and specifing your models.

## Required Packages and Datasets

Install the packages if you still don't have them (e.g. `install.packages(gapminder)`). If you don't have the `uwpols501` package, you need to install it from GitHub. Install & load the `devtools` package first, and then execute `install_github("UW-POLS501/r-uwpols501")`.
```{r, message = FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(uwpols501)
library(gapminder)
library(broom)
library(ggplot2)
data(gapminder)
data(turnout)
```

Also go to the following link to download a WDI dataset from 1980 to 2010.

`https://www.dropbox.com/s/v6h8jlphf7z739y/wdi_1980_2010.csv?dl=0`

Load the `wdi` dataset:
```{r}
wdi <- read.csv("data/wdi_1980_2010.csv")
```


## Intro
I use as a source of inspiration in this lesson Chris Adolph's POLS-503 [notes](http://faculty.washington.edu/cadolph/503/topic5.pw.pdf). 

In a linear model, any unit change of a given covariate has always the same effect on the outcome variable. If the coefficient for that covariate is for example 0.54, it doesn't matter if the unit change is from 1 to 2 or from 100,001 to 100,002. The expected effect on the outcome variable is always the same: 0.54 increase in the units of the dependent variable. 

However, theoretically we may sometimes think that the way a covariate affects the response variable is not linear. For example, is the relationship between `income` and `life expectancy` linear? Or Acemoglu and Robinson (2006) argue that the relationship between `inequality` and `democratization` follows a U-shape (we'll talk about these two examples in more detail next). How do we deal with this non-linear relationships? Can we still use a linear models to estimate them?

$y = \beta_{0} + \beta_{1}X_{1} + \beta_{2}X_{2}... + \epsilon$

## Logrithmic Transformations

Load the `gapminder` dataset from the `gapminder` package. 
Imagine that `lifeExp` is simply a linear function of `gdpPercap`.

$lifeExp = \beta_{0} + \beta_{1}gdpPercap + \epsilon$ 

Plot the outcome variable `lifeExp` against the response variable `gdpPercap`. Include a linear regression line (`geom_smoth()`) to the plot (with no confidence interal: `se = FALSE`)

```{r, fig.align='center'}
ggplot(gapminder, aes(y = lifeExp, x = gdpPercap)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE)
```

This graphs clearly shows that in the beginning, a unit increase on `gdpPercap` matters a lot in explaining `lifeExp`. However, at some point, extra units increase do not make much of a difference. We call this type of relation a *Logarithmic Relation*. How can we specify this logarithmic relation in a linear model? 

If we believe that there is a *logarithmic* relation between the outcome variable and a covariate, this is the same as saying that there is a *linear* relation between the outcome variable and the $log$ of the covariate. Thus, we just need to transform the covariate of interest by calculating its $log$ and then add the resulting variable to the linear model.

To show this, include a new variable to the `gapminder` dataset: the *log* of `gdpPercap`.
```{r}
gapminder <- mutate(gapminder, log_gdpPercap = log(gdpPercap))
```

Compare the distribution of `gdpPercap` and `log_gdpPercap` by looking at their `quantiles()`.
```{r}
data.frame(qGdp = quantile(gapminder$gdpPercap),
           qLogGdp = quantile(gapminder$log_gdpPercap))
```


Plot `lifeExp` against this new variable. Include again a linear regression line to the plot. Observe how there is a linear relation between the outcome and the *log* of the covariate. Observe also that `log_gdpPercap` is not expressed on the original units (\$ per capita) anymore but in *log* \$ per capita.

```{r, fig.align='center'}
ggplot(gapminder, aes(x = log_gdpPercap, y = lifeExp)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm")
```

The model specification describing the two regressions are.
```{r}
mod1a <- lm(lifeExp ~ gdpPercap, data = gapminder)
mod1b <- lm(lifeExp ~ log(gdpPercap), data = gapminder)
```

Let's see how well each model does in predicting the actual `lifeExp` values.
```{r}
gapminder_augm1 <- augment(mod1a, gapminder)
gapminder_augm2 <- augment(mod1b, gapminder)  
```

```{r}
ggplot(gapminder_augm1, aes(x = lifeExp, y = .fitted)) + 
  geom_point()
ggplot(gapminder_augm2, aes(x = lifeExp, y = .fitted)) +
  geom_point()
```


`r challenge_start()`
How would you create a dataset that contains the actual and predicted values of both models? Having such dataset would facilitate creating a side-by-side plot using the `facet_wrap` of `ggplot`.
`r challenge_end()`

`r solution_start()`

```{r}
predictions <- NULL
models_list <- list(mod1a, mod1b)
for (i in 1:length(models_list)) {
  m <- models_list[[i]]
  new_data <- data.frame(actual = m$model$lifeExp,
                         predicted = m$fitted.values,
                         model = i)
  predictions <- rbind(predictions, new_data)
}
```

```{r}
ggplot(predictions, aes(x = actual, y = predicted)) +
  geom_point() +
  facet_wrap(~model)
```

`r solution_end()`


`r challenge_start()`
1. Look at the regression table for `mod1b`. How would you interpret the coefficients?
2. Can you think of any covariate that you use in your own projects that has a *logarithmic relation* with the outcome variable you study? Describe that relationship.
`r challenge_end()`

## Squared Terms

Sometimes we believe that there is a U-shaped relation between a covariate and the dependent variable. For example, some scholars such as [David I. Stern](http://www.sterndavidi.com/publications_type.html) argue that there is an [Environmental Kuznets Curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuznets_curve#Environmental_Kuznets_curve). This means that there is an inverted U-shaped relation between environmental quality and economic growth. 

As we discussed in the beginning, sometimes there is a squared relation between a covariate and our dependent variable of interest (e.g. [Kuznets curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuznets_curve)).

![Source: Wikipedia](/img/env_curve.png)

How do we incorporate this theoretical expectation into a linera model? Using a *squared term*!

Estimate the following models:

1. $CO2_emissions = \beta_{0} + \beta_{1}gdpCapita + \epsilon$ 
2. $CO2_emissions = \beta_{0} + \beta_{1}log(gdpCapita) + \epsilon$ 
3. $CO2_emissions = \beta_{0} + \beta_{1}gdpCapita + \beta_{2}gdpCapita^{2} + \epsilon$ 

But first change the names of the variables of interest in the `wdi` dataset so that 
```{r}
wdi <- mutate(wdi,co2 = EN.ATM.CO2E.KT, gdpCapita = NY.GDP.PCAP.CD)
```
