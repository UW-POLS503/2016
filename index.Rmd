## Overview and Class Goals

This course continues the graduate sequence in quantitative political methodology from POLS 501.
In this course, students will learn the Statistical and computational principles necessary to perform modern, flexible, and creative analysis of quantitative social data.
This course is focused particularly on fitting, interpreting, and refining the linear regression model.
Emphasis is placed on modern interpretations of linear regression as causal inference, as well as an introduction to several modern computational tools (bootstrapping, cross-validation, regularization).


## Learning Objectives

By the end of the semester, you will be able to:

- Conduct, interpret, and communicate results from analysis using multiple regression (including dummy variables and interactions).
- Explain the limitations of observational data for making causal claims, and begin to use existing strategies for attempting to make causal claims from observational data.
- Write clean, reusable, and reliable R code.
- Build a solid, reproducible research pipeline to go from raw data to final paper.
- Feel empowered working with data.

Further, because we cannot possibly cover everything that you will need to know during your career as a researcher, there are two final long-term goals.
After this course is over, you will be able to:

- Learn new statistics
- Learn new programing


## Prerequisites

This course is designed to be a continuation of POLS/CS&SS 501.
Although that is not a formal prerequisite for this course, I will assume that students have a basic understanding of the material covered in that course.
In particular, students should have had a course in hypothesis testing, univariate statistical tests, and linear regression.
I also assume that students have proficiency in R *prior* to starting the course.


## Materials

### Reading

There are two required texts for this course,

- Angrist, Joshua D., and Jörn-Steffen Pischke. 2009. *Mostly Harmless Econometrics: An Empiricist’s Companion*.
- Wooldrige, Jeffrey M. *Introductory Econometrics*. 5th edition or earlier.

and one optional text,

- Angrist, Joshua D., and Jörn-Steffen Pischke. 2014. *Mastering 'Metrics: The Path from Cause to Effect.* This covers most of the same material as *Mostly Harmless* but at a less technical level.

Other reading will come from articles or chapters, which if not open, will be available through either the UW library, or posted on Canvas.

Finally, much of the material and reading for this course will be available in the course notes.


## Software

This course takes an applied and computational approach to learning statistics.
As such a programming language is essential.
This course uses [R]() as its statistical programming language, and the [RStudio] IDE as an interface to R.
We will make use of several R packages, with extensive use of the [Hadleyverse](http://adolfoalvarez.cl/the-hitchhikers-guide-to-the-hadleyverse/) packages ([ggplot2](https://cran.r-project.org/package=ggplot2), [dplyr](https://cran.r-project.org/package=dplyr), [tidyr](https://cran.r-project.org/package=tidyr), ...).
Additionally, this course will use [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) for writing reproducible research reports with R and [git](https://git-scm.com/) and [GitHub](https://github.com/) for version control, collaboration, and distribution of code and research.

## Assessment and Evaluation

- Reading assignments
- Weekly assignments
- Final paper

FOOLS

## Topics

Below is a list of some of the topics that this course may cover.
What is actually covered in course will depend on how the course evolves in practice.
See the [Schedule](schedule.html) for readings and schedule, though it, too, will change over the course of the quarter.

### Statistical Topics

1. Types of Research Questions: Prediction vs. Casual Inference
2. Casual Inference and the Potential Outcome Framework
3. Linear Regression

   - Multiple linear regression in matrix form
   - The conditional expectation function (CEF)
   - Functions of regressions: interactions, transformations, polynomials
   - Inference for Linear Regression
   - Properties of OLS (BLUE)
   - Interpretation and Substantive Inference. Marginal effects.
   - Robust standard errors
   - Bootstrapped standard errors
   - Power
   - Model selection
   - Prediction. Bias/Variance tradeoff
   - Regularization. Ridge regression. LASSO.
   - Cross-validation
   - Robust and resistant regression

4. Binary outcomes: Linear probability model vs. logit.
5. Matching estimators
6. Instrumental variables
7. Fixed effects
8. Difference in difference
9. Regression discontinuity

### Technical topics

1. Reproducible Research
2. Version control with GitHub
3. Reproducible documents with R Markdown
4. Programming with R: control structures, functions, apply.

## Communication

For questions about the course that would be of general interest to all students in the course, email the course mailing list, rather than the individual instructors.
Please reserve emails to individual instructors for individual concerns, such as your data analysis project or personal matters.

## Resources

Beyond what the teaching team can providing, there are several resources on campus that you can go for assistance with data, computing, and statistical problems:

-  Center for Social Science Computing and Research ([CSSCR](http://julius.csscr.washington.edu/about/consulting.html)) has a drop-in statistical consulting center in Savery 119. They provide consulting on statistical software, e.g. R. Go there for software or data related questions.
- [CSSS Statistical Consulting](https://www.csss.washington.edu/consulting) provides general statistical consulting. Go there for questions about statistical methods.
- [eScience Data Science Office Hours](http://escience.washington.edu/office-hours/)

## Inspirations

This course was inspired by and makes use of some material from:

- Christopher Adolph, [POLS 503](http://faculty.washington.edu/cadolph/?page=20). He was the previous instructor for this course.
- Jenny Bryan, [Stat 545: Data wrangling, exploration, and analysis with R]( http://stat545-ubc.github.io/)
- [Software Carpentry](https://software-carpentry.org/)
- Brenton Kenkel [PSCI 8357: Statistics for Political Research II](http://bkenkel.com/psci8357/)
- Matthew Blackwell, [Gov 2002: Causal Inference](http://www.mattblackwell.org/files/teaching/gov2002-15f-syllabus.pdf) and [GOV 1000/2000/2000e/Stat E-190: Quantitative Research Methodology](http://www.mattblackwell.org/files/teaching/gov2000-15f-syllabus.pdf).
- Matthew Salganik, [SOC 504: Sociology 504: Advanced data analysis for the social sciences](http://www.princeton.edu/~mjs3/soc504_s2015/)
- MOOCS: Mine Çetinkaya-Rundel [Sta 101](https://www2.stat.duke.edu/courses/Spring16/sta101.001/) and the [John Hopkins Data Science Sequence](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/jhu-data-science).
