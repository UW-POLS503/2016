1. For you variable of interest

    - Run a bivariate regression
    - Plot the results of the bivariate regression

4. Interactions

    - Does your theory require interactions?
    - If so, include those and interpret them?  

2. Omitted variable bias

    - What potential omitted variables can you think of?
    - Are you controlling for any variables that are mechanisms by which your variable of interest may be affecting the outcome?
    - Run a model with your controls
    - Evaluate the possible degree of omitted variable  bias using the
      proportional selection of observables and unobservables assumption (e.g. the test used in Nunn and Wantchekon)
    - If there are any particular variables that you can think of but cannot control for,
      can you reason about how they would affect the coefficients of the variable of interest.

3. Interpret the substantive effects

    - Calculate a first difference (mean + 1 sd) and its standard error.
    - What is the average marginal effect and its standard error?
    - Are there any interesting observations for which your model provides estimates?

3. Measurement error

    - Are you concerned about measurement error in any of your variables?
    - How would that measurement error affect your results?

4. Heteroskedasticity

    - Check for heteroskedasticity using a plot of studentized residuals vs. fitted values
    - Conduct a test for Breusch-Pagan test for heteroskedasticity. Does it suggest that
        there is heteroskedasticity?
    - Do you have time-series data? Calculate heteroskedasticity and autocorrelation robust standard errors
    - Do you have groups in data? What are they? Include cluster-robust standard errors.
    - Estimate your model using bootstrapped standard errors: be sure to use the correct
        data generating process.

4. Outliers

    - Check for influential observations using Cook's distance and a leverage/discrepancy plot
    - If there are outliers, can you explain them?
    - How much do your results change if you drop them?

7. Model comparison

    - Compare the MSE, R^2, and adjusted R^2 of your models. Does it make sense to use this
      statistic for model comparison?
    - Compare your models using cross-validated MSE.
    - Are there other criteria that you should use to compare the model that are
      particular to your research question?

6. Non-normal errors

    - Create a qq-plot of the studentized residuals.
    - Does this plot appear approximately normal?
    - Is the mean a reasonable summary of your outcome variable?
    - Can you respecify your model so that the errors are more normal?
