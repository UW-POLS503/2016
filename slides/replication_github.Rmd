# Why Version Control?

- Version Control
- Collaboration
- Reproducible History

# Git and Github

- **GitHub:** web-based git repository hosting service

    - Largest host of open source code
    - Source code of many R packages: [ggplot2](https://github.com/hadley/ggplot2-book), [Ropensci](http://ropensci.org/)
    - Some political scientists host replication: e.g. [Pablo Barbera](https://github.com/pablobarbera) materials for ["Echo Chambers"](https://github.com/pablobarbera/echo_chambers).
