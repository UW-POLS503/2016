You should expect this schedule to be a dynamic document.
Although the the objectives for this course are fixed, the details of how to accomplish those objectives will depend on the interaction between the instructors and students in the course.

When I make changes, these changes will be recorded in the [history](https://github.com/UW-POLS503/pols_503_sp16/commits/gh-pages/schedule.html) of this page on GitHub so that you can track what has changed.
I will notify you of changes in class or via email.

I will ask the class for feedback frequently---both in class and anonymously via surveys.
Please let me know what is working and what can be improved.
I will make adjustments based on this feedback.

## Week 2

#### Readings

- Chapters 1 and 2 of Wooldridge
- Chapter 1 of *Mostly Harmless Econometrics*
- Review matrix algebra: you should understand what vectors and matrices are. How to add, subtract, and
  multiply them. And what a matrix inverse is, what it's properties are. You don't need to worry about how to calculate a matrix inverse, since you'll never do that by hand.

   - Wooldridge appendix
   - Kahn Academy course [Matrices](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/precalculus/precalc-matrices) lessons:
     Introduction, Representing linear systems of equations, elementary matrix row operations,
     adding and subtracting matrices, multiplying matrices by scalars, properties of matrix addition
     and scalar multiplication, multiplying matrices by matrices, properties of matrix multiplication,
     introduction to matrix inverses.
