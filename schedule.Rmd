You should expect this schedule to be a dynamic document.
Although the the objectives for this course are fixed, the details of how to accomplish those objectives will depend on the interaction between the instructors and students in the course.

When I make changes, these changes will be recorded in the [history](https://github.com/UW-POLS503/pols_503_sp16/commits/gh-pages/schedule.html) of this page on GitHub so that you can track what has changed.
I will notify you of changes in class or via email.

I will ask the class for feedback frequently---both in class and anonymously via surveys.
Please let me know what is working and what can be improved.
I will make adjustments based on this feedback.

- Introduction
- Install software and set up GitHub accounts
